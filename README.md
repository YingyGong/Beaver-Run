Mario-like game with beaver running with Caltech experience

## Where to Start
Please download the repository to your local, and run "make all" command to compile the codes.
Then you will receive a link of the game.

## How to Play
### Controls (keyboard? mouse? tongue?)
- Use space for jumping when on land
- Use down arrow keys to delve in water
- Use up and down arrow keys for movement in the space

### Physics (how our game incorporates the physics engine)
- Follow Newtonian physics law (gravity, buoyancy, frictional force, etc.) 
- Beaver moves translationally on the land, floats in water and space, and is supported on the platform. 
- Beaver collides with obstacles.

### Game Flow
- Welcome page
- Start game
- 3 levels to complete, with the first two being harder than the last. When you fail a level, you will have to redo the level. Successfully finishing the level will win the beaver a college diploma.

### Features
- Physics
    - normal force on the top of items
    - gravity
    - bounce for the bottom surface
    - bonus acceleration for the sides of the bricks
    - collision between the beaver and enemies
- Music
- Point tracking system

### Power-ups
- A: ice cube. If the beaver gets an ice cube, the enemy will move very slowly (almost frozen) for a short amount of time.  
- B: boba tea. If the beaver gets some boba tea, it will earn double scores for a short amount of time.  
- C: coffee. If the beaver gets some coffee, it will get one more life.  
- D: offer. If the beaver gets an offer (internship), it can “attract” coins nearby for a short amount of time. Some coins may fly away from the beaver because it is the “tax” the beaver needs to pay, especially in scenes later. It makes sense because the more the beaver earns, higher tax it needs to pay. 

Hope you enjoy the game : )
